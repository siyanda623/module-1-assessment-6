       <h4>Description</h4> 
       Football boots are an essential part of a player's equipment. They
       are designed to provide traction on the field and grip the ground
       in order to avoid slipping and sliding. Football boots can be made
       from many different materials such as rubber, synthetic such as
       nylon and polyurethane, or leather.
